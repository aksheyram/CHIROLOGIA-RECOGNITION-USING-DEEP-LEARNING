# CHIROLOGIA-RECOGNITION-USING-DEEP-LEARNING

The task is to interpret the various hand gestures populated in the detecting environment and predict the gesture that is defined by an individual or the media source.The training data set consists of 185 images for each of the digit from 0 to 9 individually. The testing data set consists of 20 images again for each of the digit individually.‚óè	The architecture includes 13 convolution layers, 5 pooling layers and three fully connected layers. All the layers were associated with a reLu activatiuon function. The model attained an accuracy of 91%.
